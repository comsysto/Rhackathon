Ideas for Analyses
======================

Descriptive Statistic:
* how long is a meetup?
* at which time do meetups start?
* what is prefered weekday?

Tag Analyses:
* create a word cloud for all tags
* analyse tags over time

Location based Analyses:
* location plots (density plot)

Predictive Analyses:
* when and where will be the next meeting for a defined topic?

Future:
* extend external information: weather, Meetup API (number of participants)
